You can reach me by email: rogelio.murillo@valpo.edu 

I am a recent graduate from Valparaiso University (Dec 23'). I have been programming for about 2-3 years now. 
I am currently...
- Seeking employment
- Working on a few projects... (playlist converter, game, paintapp)
- Planning another another project (i know. ill finish the others eventually :] lol )

## Outside of programming
### Modding
I have worked on a lot of modding at a young age which developed my computer skills to a high degree. 
Such as modding game systems like Wii, WiiU, ps3, 3DS, and switch! (I really want a steamdeck)
### Health & Fitness
I know talking about fitness on my hacker site is a bit odd but I am proud to be training for marathons and have an upcoming half marathon in September!!
